# Battleship
## Overview
This is a school project made by team of 2.

We were given a non functionnal project and the goal for us was to debug it in order to get a playable game.
## Features

It is a classical battleship game :
   - place your ships on the grid
   - shoot and try to sink your opponent float
     

When opening the project, you can choose who starts between you and the computer.
You can choose the difficulty too :
  - `easy` : the computer shoots randomly
  - `difficult` : when the computer hits one of your boats, it will target the cases around.
